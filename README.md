# It's Rating Cats and Dogs

It's Rating Cats and Dogs is a simple voting app that I built using Sinatra to learn how to call data from a public API that does not require authentication.

The goal of the project was to present the user with a random picture of a dog and a cat from two different API's. The cat would be served using a server side API call and the dog would be served using a client side API call.

## APIs

Random cat pictures are generated by [RandomCat](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

Random dog pictures are generated by [RandomDog](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

## Getting Started

Clone the project to your local machine.

Navigate to the root directory of the project.

Run the following command to start the
app.

```
ruby vote.rb
```

In your browser of choice, visit:

`http://localhost:4567/`
